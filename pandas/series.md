18. **Use Series to filter another Series**
    - Create two Series from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[True, False, True, False, True]`, and use the second Series to filter the first Series.

19. **Convert Series to list**
    - Convert the Series created from the list in problem 1 to a Python list.

20. **Plot a Series**
    - Plot the Series created from the list in problem 1 using Matplotlib.

### Solutions

1. **Create a Series from a list**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   series1 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
   print(series1)
   ```

2. **Create a Series from a dictionary**
   ```python
   series2 = pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4})
   print(series2)
   ```

3. **Access elements by index**
   ```python
   element = series1[2]
   print(element)
   ```

4. **Access elements by label**
   ```python
   element = series2['c']
   print(element)
   ```

5. **Change the index of a Series**
   ```python
   series1.index = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
   print(series1)
   ```

6. **Perform arithmetic operations**
   ```python
   series1_plus_5 = series1 + 5
   print(series1_plus_5)
   ```

7. **Filter elements based on a condition**
   ```python
   filtered_series = series1[series1 > 20]
   print(filtered_series)
   ```

8. **Check for missing values**
   ```python
   series_with_nan = pd.Series([1, 2, None, 4, 5])
   missing_values = series_with_nan.isnull()
   print(missing_values)
   ```

9. **Fill missing values**
   ```python
   filled_series = series_with_nan.fillna(series_with_nan.mean())
   print(filled_series)
   ```

10. **Create a Series from a NumPy array**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    series_from_array = pd.Series(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    print(series_from_array)
    ```

11. **Series with datetime index**
    ```python
    date_range = pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', periods=5)
